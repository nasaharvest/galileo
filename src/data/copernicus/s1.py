"""Sentinel-1 data fetching logic.

This module handles the specific details of searching for and fetching Sentinel-1 SAR imagery.
Sentinel-1 provides Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data that works day/night and through clouds,
making it complementary to optical imagery from Sentinel-2.

Key features:
- Searches Copernicus catalog for SAR products with specific polarizations and orbit directions
- Filters by product type (GRD, SLC, OCN) and radar polarization modes
- Creates metadata files for discovered products (actual download to be implemented later)
- Implements caching to avoid repeated API calls for the same requests

SAR Background:
- SAR uses microwave radiation to image the Earth's surface
- Different polarizations (VV, VH, HH, HV) reveal different surface properties
- Orbit direction affects the viewing angle and shadow patterns

    """Fetch Sentinel-1 products for given parameters.

    This is the main entry point for Sentinel-1 SAR data fetching. It handles the complete workflow:
    1. Check if results are already cached
    2. If not cached, search the Copernicus catalog for matching SAR products
    3. Download actual SAR imagery or create metadata files
    4. Cache the results for future requests

    Args:
        client: CopernicusClient instance providing authentication and caching infrastructure
        bbox: [min_lon, min_lat, max_lon, max_lat] in WGS84 coordinate system
              Example: [6.15, 49.11, 6.16, 49.12] for 800m x 800m area in Luxembourg
        start_date: Start date in YYYY-MM-DD format
                   Example: "2024-01-01"
        end_date: End date in YYYY-MM-DD format
                 Example: "2024-01-31"
        product_type: SAR product type:
                     - "GRD": Ground Range Detected (most common, preprocessed and geocoded)
                             Best for most applications, ready to use
                     - "SLC": Single Look Complex (raw data in slant range geometry)
                             Requires more processing, used for interferometry
                     - "OCN": Ocean products (specialized for ocean wind/wave analysis)
        polarization: Radar polarization modes (e.g., "VV,VH"):
                     - "VV": Vertical transmit, Vertical receive (good for water, urban)
                     - "VH": Vertical transmit, Horizontal receive (good for vegetation)
                     - "HH": Horizontal transmit, Horizontal receive (less common)
                     - "HV": Horizontal transmit, Vertical receive (less common)
                     Most land applications use "VV,VH" (dual polarization)
        orbit_direction: Satellite orbit direction:
                        - "ASCENDING": Moving from south to north (evening pass)
                        - "DESCENDING": Moving from north to south (morning pass)
                        Different directions show different aspects of terrain
        acquisition_mode: SAR acquisition mode (default: "IW")

                         WHAT IS ACQUISITION MODE:
                         Sentinel-1 SAR can operate in different imaging modes,
                         like a camera with different lenses. Each mode trades
                         off between coverage area and resolution.

                         AVAILABLE MODES:
                         - "IW" (Interferometric Wide Swath): DEFAULT
                           Coverage: 250km wide, Resolution: 10m
                           Use: General land monitoring (95% of cases)
                           Best for: Agriculture, forests, urban areas, most ML applications

                         - "EW" (Extra Wide Swath):
                           Coverage: 400km wide, Resolution: 40m
                           Use: Ocean monitoring, polar regions, wide area surveillance
                           Best for: Maritime surveillance, ice sheets, large-scale monitoring

                         - "SM" (Strip Map):
                           Coverage: 80km wide, Resolution: 5m
                           Use: Emergency response, detailed monitoring
                           Best for: Disasters, high-detail urban mapping, infrastructure

                         - "WV" (Wave Mode):
                           Coverage: 20km samples, Resolution: 5m
                           Use: Ocean wave studies (very specialized)
                           Best for: Ocean wave height/direction analysis

                         WHAT CHANGES WITH MODE:
                         ✅ Resolution (how detailed the image is)
                            IW=10m, EW=40m, SM=5m, WV=5m
                         ✅ Coverage area (how wide the swath is)
                            IW=250km, EW=400km, SM=80km, WV=20km samples
                         ✅ Image size (number of pixels)
                            Higher resolution = more pixels for same area

                         WHAT DOESN'T CHANGE:
                         ❌ Polarizations (always VV, VH or HH, HV)
                         ❌ Data format (always 2-channel array)
                         ❌ Visualization (same grayscale SAR display)
                         ❌ Processing code (same functions work for all modes)
                         ❌ Backscatter values (same dB range -30 to 0)

                         VISUAL COMPARISON:
                         Satellite flying →

                         EW Mode:  ████████████████████████████████  (400km, lower res)
                         IW Mode:  ████████████████████              (250km, good res) ← DEFAULT
                         SM Mode:  ██████████                        (80km, high res)
                         WV Mode:  ██  ██  ██  ██                    (samples only)

                         FOR GALILEO ML:
                         - Use IW mode (default) for consistency across your dataset
                         - Don't mix modes in the same training set (different resolutions)
                         - IW provides the best balance of coverage and resolution
                         - Most Sentinel-1 data available is IW mode (95%+ of acquisitions)

                         WHEN TO USE EACH MODE:
                         - IW: Default choice, works for 95% of use cases
                               Land monitoring, agriculture, forestry, urban areas
                         - EW: When you need very wide coverage and resolution isn't critical
                               Ocean monitoring, polar ice, maritime surveillance
                         - SM: When you need maximum detail in a smaller area
                               Emergency response, disaster mapping, detailed infrastructure
                         - WV: Only for specialized ocean wave analysis
                               Rarely used for general remote sensing

                         Example:
                         >>> # Default (IW) - works for 95% of cases
                         >>> s1_files = client.fetch_s1(bbox, start_date, end_date)
                         >>>
                         >>> # Ocean monitoring - use EW for wide coverage
                         >>> s1_files = client.fetch_s1(bbox, start_date, end_date,
                         ...                            acquisition_mode="EW")
                         >>>
                         >>> # Disaster response - use SM for high detail
                         >>> s1_files = client.fetch_s1(bbox, start_date, end_date,
                         ...                            acquisition_mode="SM")
                         >>>
                         >>> # Ocean wave analysis - use WV (specialized)
                         >>> s1_files = client.fetch_s1(bbox, start_date, end_date,
                         ...                            acquisition_mode="WV")
        download_data: If True, download actual SAR imagery (1-2GB per product)
                      If False, only create metadata files (few KB per product)
                      Default: True
        max_products: Maximum number of products to download/process
                     Default: 3 (prevents accidental huge downloads)
                     Set to None for unlimited (use with caution!)

                     WHY LIMIT:
                     - Each S1 product is 1-2GB
                     - 10 products = 10-20GB disk space
                     - Downloads can take hours

                     Example: For 1 year of data over small area,
                     you might get 70+ products (one every 5 days).
                     Default limit prevents overwhelming your system.

    """Download actual Sentinel-1 SAR satellite imagery.

    This function downloads the complete SAR product from Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem.
    Sentinel-1 products are typically 1-2GB in size and contain radar backscatter data.

    WHAT IS SENTINEL-1:
    Sentinel-1 is a radar (SAR - Synthetic Aperture Radar) satellite that:
    - Works day and night (doesn't need sunlight like optical satellites)
    - Penetrates clouds (radar waves pass through clouds and rain)
    - Measures surface roughness (smooth surfaces = dark, rough surfaces = bright)
    - Provides all-weather monitoring capability

    WHAT'S IN A SENTINEL-1 PRODUCT:
    - Radar backscatter images in different polarizations (VV, VH)
    - Calibration data for converting to physical units (sigma0, gamma0)
    - Metadata about acquisition geometry and processing
    - Typically 1-2GB per product (larger than Sentinel-2)

    HOW S1 DIFFERS FROM S2:
    - S1 = Radar (active sensor, sends and receives microwaves)
    - S2 = Optical (passive sensor, measures reflected sunlight)
    - S1 has polarizations (VV, VH) not spectral bands (B01-B12)
    - S1 file structure uses .tiff files, not .jp2 files
    - S1 products are larger (1-2GB vs 500MB-1GB for S2)
